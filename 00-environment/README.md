I'm working on a Mac, though Linux is better because it will have all the standard tools already
available for you.

On a mac, [install Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and then `brew install qemu nasm`

Don't use the Xcode developer tools `nasm` if you have them installed, they won't work for the most cases.
