*Concepts you may want to Google beforehand: XX*

**Goal: Fix miscellaneous issues with our code**

The OSDev wiki has a section [which describes some issues with
JamesM's tutorial](http://wiki.osdev.org/James_Molloy%27s_Tutorial_Known_Bugs).
Since we followed his tutorial for lessons 18-22 (interrupts through malloc), we'll
need to make sure we fix any of the issues before moving on.
